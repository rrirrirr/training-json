# Completion Tasks

When a task is completed:

1. **Review Code Changes**:
   - Ensure all changes are implemented according to requirements
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify responsive design works properly
   - Make sure Shadcn UI components are used consistently
   - Confirm className composition with cn() is used properly

2. **Test Functionality**:
   - If developing locally, test changes in a browser
   - Test different screen sizes for responsive design
   - Verify modals and state management work correctly

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure code follows the project's coding conventions
   - Properly documented types and interfaces
   - Clean and readable code with proper indentation
   - No unused imports or variables

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Add changed files to git staging (`git add .`)
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message (`git commit -m "..."`)
   - Push changes if needed (`git push`)

Since there are no specific testing, linting, or formatting commands mentioned in the documentation, follow standard Next.js/React practices.
